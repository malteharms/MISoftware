| Branch pattern     | When to use |

| design/<element>   | This is a design structure, a big difference for user experience. Should be a permanent branch to continuously work on it.  |
| ui/<element>       | UI elements are small details or little components inside the user interface. Can be removed after merging into main.       |
| feature/<element>  | Features are functionalities which will be included into the software. Most of the time they are related to improvements.   |
| bug/<element>      | A bug branch should be created for solving an issue.                                                                        |
